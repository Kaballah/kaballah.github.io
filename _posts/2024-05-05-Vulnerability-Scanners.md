## Vulnerability Scanners

__Vulnerability Scanners__ are automated tools that systematically examine computer systems, networks, and applications for known security weaknesses.  These weaknesses, or vulnerabilities, can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access, steal data, disrupt operations, or install malware.

Here is a different example for you. Imagine your favorite superhero! Maybe it's Wonder Woman, with her super strength and awesome shield, or maybe it's Captain America, always ready with a plan. Well, guess what? The digital world has its own superheroes too, and they're called *vulnerability scanners*! These scanners are like super-powered flashlights that help us find cracks and holes in our digital castles (computers and websites). Just like a leaky roof needs fixing, these cracks need patching to keep the bad guys out!

## Examples
Here are some examples of vulnerability scanner that are used everyday by hackers:
-	[*Nessus Professional:*](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) A comprehensive vulnerability scanner, Nessus Professional is ideal for businesses or security professionals seeking in-depth analysis of network vulnerabilities.A leader in vulnerability management, Nessus Professional provides comprehensive assessments. It scans for a wide range of vulnerabilities across operating systems, applications, network devices, and cloud configurations. Nessus also offers advanced features like social engineering threat modeling and detailed reporting capabilities. [Usage](/posts/Nessus)
*	[*OpenVAS:*](https://openvas.org/) This open-source scanner empowers experienced users with granular control over vulnerability assessments.  OpenVAS offers a vast library of vulnerability checks and plugins, allowing for customization of scans based on specific needs. However, the learning curve can be steeper compared to user-friendly commercial tools. [Usage](/posts/OpenVAS)
- [*OWASP ZAP:*](https://www.zaproxy.org/)  This open-source project provides a comprehensive toolkit for web application security testing.  OWASP ZAP consists of various modules for proxy interception, brute-force attacks (controlled environments), and security header testing. Its modular design allows users to customize their testing approach based on specific needs. [Usage](/posts/OWASP)
* [*Nexpose Community:*](https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/) This free version offers asset discovery and vulnerability assessment capabilities. It identifies basic vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, and network devices. While not as comprehensive as paid options, Nexpose Community is a valuable starting point for individuals or small businesses.
- [*Qualys VMDR:*](https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/)  This cloud-based platform goes beyond basic vulnerability scanning.  Qualys VMDR offers vulnerability prioritization, automated remediation workflows, and continuous monitoring. This centralized solution streamlines vulnerability management for large organizations with complex network infrastructures.
* [*Invicti:*](https://www.invicti.com/)  Formally known as Netsparker, Invicti is dedicated to web application security, utilizing a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques.  It identifies vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references (IDOR). Invicti also provides features for manual exploitation attempts in a controlled environment, helping developers understand the potential impact of vulnerabilities.
- [*Acunetix:*](https://www.acunetix.com/)  This web vulnerability scanner offers a structured approach to web application security testing.  Acunetix crawls websites, identifying potential security risks like weak authentication mechanisms and insecure file uploads. It also provides detailed reports with remediation recommendations, allowing developers to prioritize and address vulnerabilities effectively.
* [*Vega:*](https://subgraph.com/vega/)  While not as user-friendly as some commercial tools, Vega offers a powerful and versatile platform for web application security testing.  It supports scripting languages like Python, allowing for automation of complex testing procedures. Vega caters to experienced security professionals seeking a customizable solution.
- [*Burp Suite Community Edition:*](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)  This free edition of the popular Burp Suite platform provides a solid foundation for web application security testing.  It offers tools for manual testing, including an intercepting proxy and a web application scanner. Burp Suite Community Edition allows users to learn the fundamentals of web application security testing before potentially upgrading to the paid version with more advanced features.
* [*SQLmap:*](https://sqlmap.org/)  This specialized tool focuses on a specific vulnerability type â€“ SQL injection.  SQLmap automates the process of identifying and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in database servers.  While a valuable tool for security professionals performing penetration testing,  SQLmap should be used responsibly and only in controlled environments.

## How Do They Word?

Here's a deeper dive into their technical functionalities:
1. Vulnerability Assessment: Vulnerability scanners employ a variety of techniques to identify potential security flaws. These techniques include:
* Signature-based scanning: This method compares the system's configuration and code against a database of known vulnerabilities. If a match is found, the scanner flags it as a potential risk.
* Fuzzing: Fuzzing involves sending malformed or unexpected data to an application or system to see if it crashes or reveals vulnerabilities.
* Static code analysis: This technique analyzes the source code of an application to identify potential vulnerabilities without executing the code.
2. Risk Assessment:  Beyond just identifying vulnerabilities, some scanners go a step further by assigning a risk score based on factors like exploitability, potential impact, and ease of remediation. This allows security teams to prioritize which vulnerabilities should be addressed first.
3. Reporting:  Vulnerability scanners generate reports that detail the identified vulnerabilities, their severity level, and potential consequences. These reports can be used by security teams to understand their security posture and plan remediation efforts.
4. Fixing: With the report card in hand, you can patch up the vulnerabilities! You might need to download an update or change a password.

## Benefits of Vulnerability Scanners

+ Automation: Vulnerability scanners automate a time-consuming and tedious task, allowing security teams to focus on other critical activities.
+ Comprehensiveness: Scanners can identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including those that might be missed by manual security assessments.
+ Standardization: Vulnerability scanners provide a consistent and repeatable approach to security assessments, allowing for easier comparison of results over time.
+ Prioritization: Risk scoring within reports helps teams prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities to address first.

## Limitations of Vulnerability Scanners

- False Positives: Scanners can sometimes identify vulnerabilities that turn out to be harmless (false positives). This can lead to wasted time and resources investigating non-existent threats.
- False Negatives: On the other hand, scanners might miss some vulnerabilities altogether (false negatives). This can leave systems exposed to potential attacks.
- Limited Scope: Many scanners only identify known vulnerabilities. Zero-day vulnerabilities, which are unknown to security researchers, might remain undetected
