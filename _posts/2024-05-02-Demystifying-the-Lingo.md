# Demystifying the Lingo

In most cybersecurity articles, you would feel like the topic is just speaking some alien language. Not to worry, though; you are really not alone. The glossary below arms you with need-to-know terms from the world of ethical hacking and cybersecurity so that you can become more informed, ready to chat.

## General Terminology
+ __Attack:__ Looking for an unauthorized direct access onto a system or network. (Imagine people trying to break into your home.)
- **Black Hat Hacker:** Perhaps a Black Hat Hacker can be best defined as a hacker who violates systems illegally with the purpose of acquiring personal benefits by theft of data or system sabotage.
+ __Cybersecurity:__ A basic conceptual framework within which the fundamental attributes so required to secure information, systems, networks, and data from unauthorized accesses, usages, disclosures, disruptions, modifications, or destruction are provided for (The security system for your digital world).
- **Data Breach:** This refers to the unintended exposure or theft of sensitive information, such as a person finding and stealing your personal information, like a name, number, etc.
+ __Encryption:__ The conversion of information into code for security purposes, especially conversion by using special codes or ciphers to convert back to a readable form.
- **Ethical Hacking (White Hat):** A skilled person in the field of an effort to locate underlying vulnerabilities in a system or network to disclose before a malicious actor can find and release an incursion. (The good guy testing your house security to find weaknesses)
* __Exploit:__ a specific instance of employing a discovered vulnerability in a system; for example, the tool that a burglar might use to jimmy open your window.
+ __Firewall:__ This is the security system that either prohibits or allows Network to transit it. It more or less can be referred to as the securities at the door of your digital castle.
* __Grey Hat Hacker:__ A Grey Hat Hacker is one who works with a balance between good and bad. Sometimes they would have to work for the purposes of unauthorized testing or with the skills that are "for the goodness" but without following all the rules (neither a hero nor a villain).
- **Malware:** Program-serving software, sentence to damage any computer system with the intent, either deliberately or unintentionally, to retrieve information or impose an operational disruption. Wear protective apparently, or
+ __Patch:__ Fix to a specific problem or fixification within any system. For example, fixing the broken window to prevent burglaries.
- **Penetration Testing:** mainly involves the stimulation of a cyber-attack so as to check for the areas the system security is weak in (from "ethical hacker: testing your defenses").
+ __Phishing:__ It is a form of scamming where social engineering is used to elicit information. For example, trying to get someone to give their password by pretending to be their bank. 
* **Risk:** This is the probability of threat exploiting a vulnerability, and therefore causing harm to the asset (Mansoor, what are the odds of someone breaking into your house).
- **Script Kiddie:** An amateur hacker who may even know how to write the malicious code by himself but does not have the intrusion capabilities, either physical or technical. He uses existing software to launch attack attempts and exploits weaknesses in
+ __Social Engineering:__ Generally, it refers to a stat in which a trick or manipulation of people is done to get them to disclose private information or to perform certain acts that would be harmful to security (for example, tricking someone into giving away his password).
- **Threat:** An actor or event with the potential for damage to the network or its resources.
(An actor or even just a tremor, and it would always be able to breach your house)
+ __Vulnurability:__ Website or application vulnerability. A weakness in a system, network, or application that an attacker could exploit to attack your system (e.g., it's like having a loose lock on your back door).

## Ethical Hacking Terminology

* **Enumeration information:** "Gathering information about a system or network to identify potential vulnerabilities (in other words, the ethical hacker figures out what security systems you have).
- __Footprinting:__ It is the first stage of a penetration test. Footprinting is a process in which baseline information is gathered about the target system by an ethical hacker. Like "Learning your address and what kind of security system you might have.
* **Metasploit:** A widely used framework for developing and testing exploit code. (The ethical hacker's toolkit.)
- __Packet Sniffer:__ This is a software tool that captures data packets that flow in a network for one to peer and investigate the communication protocol analysis for potential security risks. (The ethical hacker was permitted to be eavesdropping on your network conversations.)
* **Penetration Tester (Ethical Hacker, White Hat Hacker):** A security professional hired by an organization and given every permission to attempt to compromise its computer systems in order to locate and fix security vulnerabilities. (The hired security professional that tests your defenses) 
- __Social Engineering Assessment:__ Another work unit near the lines of ethical hacking which homes in on ways of entering by the use of socially engineered tactics. (The hacker tries to fool your employees into giving him or her informationâ€”just for security testing purposes.)
* **Zero-Day Attack:** A type of security attack that takes advantage of software or hardware vulnerabilities that haven't been identified yet. This is a whole new method of breaking into stuff; no one knew it's possible. 

Well, that is just the tip of the iceberg! The cybersecurity landscape has, to say the least, been dynamic, with terms rolling in with every turn of events. However, at least with this basic grounding, you would be in a much better place to appreciate the dialect within the entire digital security space.
