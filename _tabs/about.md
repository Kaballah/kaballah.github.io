<!-- About Ronnie Kaballah: -->

Hello there! My name is Ronnie Kaballah and I am currently pursuing my studies in Bachelor of Science in Computer Security and Forensics at KCA University. I am extremely passionate about the field of cyber security and it has always ignited a sense of enthusiasm within me. Through my course, I have had the opportunity to delve deep into various aspects of cyber security such as ethical hacking, vulnerability and penetration testing, machine learning, wireless and mobile forensics, and many more.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I also have a fun side to me. I enjoy practicing my skills in various hacking websites, as it allows me to constantly sharpen my abilities and stay up to date with the latest techniques. In my leisure time, I also indulge in photography, listening to music, watching movies, and of course, programming.
